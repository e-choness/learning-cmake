# :fire:Self-Taught CMake Examples

## :pencil2: Notes

- This example is done mainly using CMake command lines and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with `CMake Tools`/`CMake Tools Extension` and related plugins.
- [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) also does a great job supporting complete configuration and CMake automation.
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) also supports CMake, it's just not my first choice of IDE.

## :fork_and_knife: VS Code Shortcuts

Before going for basic setups, here are some VS Code shortcuts that are good to know.

| Shortcut | Description |
|---|---|
| `F7` | Build the project. |
| `Ctrl+Shift+P`| Summon command palette, where commands like `cmake:configure` can be called here. |
| `Ctrl+P` | Quick search on the files in the project. |

## üê≠ Minimum Setup

- `cmake_minimum_required` is the bare minimum required statement for specifying the cmake version the project is build on.
- `project(${PROJECT_NAME} VERSION x.x.x)` is giving a project a name and version to build. `VERSION` has to be upper case, CMake is case sensitive on that regard.

## üê± C++ Standard Declarations

- `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD xx)` is to set C++ standard to compile, `xx` can be 11, 14, 17, 20 and 23. The command is using `CXX` instead of `C++` or `CPP` is because this is easier to parse for the OS file system. I don't know how it came to be but it's a thing that people just generally agreed on.
- `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True/False)` is line is not required, but if the project is heavily relying on a specific C++ standard version, forcefully set a C++ standard might not be a bad idea.
- `target_compile_features()` specifies compiler features when compiling a given target. Want to give compiler features C++20 standard, set `target_compile_features(${TARGET} PRIVATE cxx_std_20)`.

## C and C++ Compilers adn Build Tools

There are many compilers to chose from depending on the build environment.

- For Windows MSVC compilers, provided those are installed through Visual Studio or Tools for Visual Studio, let CMake Tools configuration scan for them and it will show up in compiler settings.
- Clang can also be grabbed from Visual Studio Individual Components. CMake Tools scan will pair GNU CLI with Ninja. Ninja is a fast, light-weight and multi-platform build tool if the program is targeting for multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).
- `cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPLIER=g++ <source-dir>` specifies compiler. If the compiler is not avaialbe, cmake will revert to default compiler setting.
- MSVC generator is limited to it's own compiler. Ninja and MinGW can use g++ and Clang.

## Project Versioning

There are many ways to version a project. Two are demostrated in this project

- `target_compile_definitions` is a way to specify the library properties such as library version and others to help define specific complication actions. The definition can be captured in the C++ program as well. Setting it to `PUBLIC`, the definitions will be accessible to source code outside of the library, `PRIVATE` on the other hand, will not propagate to code inside the library. `INTERFACE` does the exact opposite to `PRIVATE`. These are powerful features of CMake, will help a great deal for build automation.

```cmake
target_compile_definitions(${HELLO_LIB} PUBLIC SAY_HELLO_VERSION="1.1")
# Note: if version formated 1.x.x, add double quotes to it.
```

- `configure_file(Config.h.in Config.h)` will take the contents inside `Config.h.hin` to generate a header file `Config.h`, and make sure to include the header's directory to the project. After cmake generate or configures the project files, the header can be included within declared scope.

## :+1: Add Executable

- `add_executable(<executable-name> <entry-cpp>)` adds the sources code and tell CMake to compile it into an executable.

## :bookmark_tabs: Add Subdirectory

- One thing that came up with `add_subdirectory` to organize the projects is always trying to include headers. `target_include_directory` can help locate library header files. VS Code still mark inline errors for including headers. If CMake compiles and builds the project without problem, it's safe to ignore IDE errors.

- `add_subdirectory()` accepts a second argument stating a newly named directory dedicated to the subdirectory in the build folder.

## :card_index: Add Library

- `add_library(<library-name> <library-source> <library-header>)`.
- After `<library-name>` we can declare `STATIC`, `SHARED` or `MODULE` as library property. `STATIC` is built by default.
- `target_link_library(<executable-name> <library-name>)` will link the library to the executable. Before `<library-name>` it can be declared as `PUBLIC` OR `PRIVATE`.

## Include Headers

- `target_include_directories(<project> [accessibility] <header-directory>)` includes the headers.

- The code below works but not recommended by official CMake practices.

```cmake
    file(GLOB SOURCE_FILES src/*.cpp)
    add_executable(hello entry.cpp ${SOURCE_FILES})
```

## :wrench: Scripting in CMake

- Literally every variable data in CMake is a string, with the simplicity of scripting it might take more effort for developers to process.
- `command_name(<list of arguments>)` outputs commands that feeds into the executable.
- `message()` outputs the contents to the console when configuring and compiling in CMake.
- Variables are interpreted using `${}` syntax.
- `if()` `endif()` is paird statements for conditional control flow for scripting cmake. The conditions inside `if()` resulted in `TRUE`, it will go on with the operations inside the if statement.
- `EQUAL` compares numerical values, `STREQUAL` compares string values.
- `while()` `endwhile()` is one type of loop that runs as long as the condition in `while()` is met.
- `foreach()` `endforeach()` enumerates from a numerical range or a string array.

## :mag: Independent CMake Scripts

CMake can utilize files structures to facilitate readable code. A good use of CMake scripts would be beneficial to a project's build system.

- CMake scripts are associated with files ended with `.cmake`.
- To add functions or commands inside a CMake script, simply use the script path with `include()` command.
- CMake scripts are like any other files in the project, use `file()` command to bundle any scripts into a path list. Then iterate through the list to include everything needed.
- Each `CMakeLists.txt` will execute in parallel. Take note that when iterating through a script list, it might not be included when the `CMakeLists.txt` beneath the hirarchy. It will cause dependency problem, it might be safe to re-include dependent scripts.
- When evaluating a script using `cmake -P <cmake-script.cmake>`, the directory will output differently depending on whether it's in the source or binary directory.

## :trumpet: Arrays

- Declaring a variable with a set of values using `set()`.
- Output the array values using `${}` it expands each element as a variable of its own.
- Output the array values usign `"${}"` it concat each element into a single string, separated by semi-colon.
- When packing several variables inside meta-variable it would be best to dereference without double quotes, such that it expands each variable properly.

## :capital_abcd: Variables and Scope

- Functions are explained in #:1234: Functions section.
- Varaibles declared inside a function scope without `PARENT_SCOPE` property does not change the variable value outside of the function.
- Variables declared after the definition of the function can also be recognized by the function as long as it is declared before the function is called.
- Variable as arguments needs double quotes wrapped with double dereferencing to get the value, like `"${${VAR}}"`.

## :1234: Functions

- `function()` `endfunction()` is used to define a fuction. The first argument is always the name of the function. The following arguments are the list of arguments passed in.
- `ARGN` captures all the arguments passed in when the function is called.
- `ARGV` captures the arguments passed in but outside the range of defined arguments.
- To return a value, set a global variable with the updated value and set its property to `PARENT_SCOPE`. An example `set("${GLOBAL_VALUE}" "${UPDATED_VALUE}" PARENT_SCOPE)`. Make sure to dereference them in `set()` command.

## :scissors: CMake Arguments Parsing

It would be confusing if the relationship between the declared arguments are unclear.

- `cmake_parse_arguments()` captures arguments declared by `set()`.
- `<prefix>_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS` captures obviously, unparsed arguments. Can be put into a list using `foreach(args IN LISTS <prefix>_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS)` to output each of them.
- One advantage of specifying arguments is that the function can dynamically take arguments without introducing build errors if unsufficiant arguments are passed in.
- Put `WARNING` in `message()` can output warnings instead of plain debug messages.
- Using `if(DEFINED VARIABLE)` where `VARIABLE` is a parsed variable. When it is passed when the function is called, the steps within the directive will execute.

## :first_quarter_moon: CTest

CTest is a key tool to add test driven system within the CMake build system. Both White- and black box testing are supported.

- CMake facilitates testing source code through commands and `CTest` executable.
- `add_test` generates a test executable based on a source code executable.
- Since variable values are strings, test actual result property can be set as `PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`, followed by raw strings such as "^Hello, world!".
- It would be more robust to introduce functions to each unit test, less prone to typos and bugs.

## :memo: Useful Commands

### :bell: Basics

- Under `<build-directory>` Run `cmake <source-directory>` can build project source files within specified `<build-directory>`.
- `cmake --build <build-directory>` do linking, compiling and building executable.
- `cmake -G Ninja <source-directory>` builds project using Ninja toolchain using source files from `<source directory>`. (In this case it doesn't quite work yet. Need investigation.)

### :floppy_disk: Settings

| Command| Description |
|---|---|
| `set CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja` | Set default CMake generator as Ninja. |
| `ldd <executable>` | List library linking activities. |
| `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=TRUE` | Set building shared library by default. |
| `ls ENV:` | Output environmental variables. Useful when looking for compiler settings and include paths without using any IDEs.  |
| `echo $env:INCLUDE` | Output include paths. |
| `rm *`| Remove everything from a folder, it's useful when clearing build folder and experimenting on different generators |
| `cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cl -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=cl <source-directory>` | Build the program with Ninja generator and clang as compiler. |
| `cmake <source-directory>`| Generate or regenerate solution for the project. |
| `cmake -P <cmake-script.cmake>` | Evaluate the specified CMake script. It runs the scripts without having any `include()` commands from the other scripts.|
